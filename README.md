# Supermarket Simulation
This python program applyies the Markov Chain and Monte-Carlo modeling to simulates and visualizes customer behavior such as the transition probability: which aisles will the customer choose to shop? Or pehaps, even calculatin the the amount of time and money they spend at each aisle . The simulation can be based on any day of the week or on the whole weekdays with a given number of customers. 

The project roughly consists of four stages:

1. Data Exploration
2. Calculation of the Transition Probabilities
3. Implementation of a Markov Chain-based simulator (for 1 or many customers)
4. Visualization on how customers move through the supermarket

A sample of the visualization can be seen here (with adapted shopping items and customer icons for fun purposes):
